                            I am a seasoned Lead Portal Developer with 20+ years of experience designing and implementing web-based business solutions using open-source technologies.
                            My expertise lies in Java, Spring MVC, React, and database development, along with a strong background in Agile and Waterfall methodologies.
                            Throughout my career at Office Depot, I have led development teams, modernized legacy systems, and built mission-critical applications like the Vendor Portal, which streamlined business operations and generated significant cost savings.
                            My technical skills span multiple platforms, including WebSphere, Tomcat, and Oracle WebLogic, and I have successfully managed large-scale projects that integrate and optimize enterprise systems.

                        <p>
                            Beyond software development, I excel in strategic problem-solving and cost-reduction initiatives.
                            I have led teams in migrating legacy COBOL and CICS systems to Java, negotiated contracts to reduce licensing costs, and championed open-source adoption to enhance efficiency.
                            With a Masterâ€™s in Accounting from Florida International University and a Bachelor's in Business Administration from the University of Florida, I bring both technical expertise and a deep understanding of business processes.
                            My ability to innovate, lead cross-functional teams, and drive digital transformation makes me a strong asset in any technology-driven organization.
